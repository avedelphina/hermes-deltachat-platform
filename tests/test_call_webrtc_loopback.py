"""WebRTC loopback diagnostics for outgoing (offerer) calls.

The real failure is: as the WebRTC *offerer* (outgoing call), aiortc's ICE
never establishes a media path, while as the *answerer* (incoming) it works.
These tests negotiate two in-process aiortc RTCPeerConnections — a "bot"
offerer using our real CallManager._new_peer_connection setup (audio track +
the iceTrickling/mutedState negotiated data channels) against a mock
answerer — and check whether the offerer reaches connectionState=connected.

This answers ONE high-value question cheaply (no phone):
  * Does our offerer path connect against a cooperative aiortc answerer?
    - PASS  → the offerer code is fine; the real bug is specific to the
              browser/DC-mobile answerer (max-bundle + trickle + NAT).
    - FAIL  → the bug is in our offerer setup; iterate here.

CAVEAT: aiortc-vs-aiortc on loopback does NOT reproduce the browser's bundle/
trickle behavior or the NAT/TURN path, so a PASS here does not guarantee the
phone works — final confirmation still needs a live call. Treat as a fast
diagnostic + regression guard, not a workaround oracle.

Run: nix develop --command bash -c \
    "cd tests && python3 -m pytest test_call_webrtc_loopback.py -q -s"
