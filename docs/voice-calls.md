# Voice Calls

The adapter can both **answer incoming** Delta Chat voice calls and **place
outgoing** ones, holding a spoken conversation either way: audio →
speech-to-text → Hermes AI → text-to-speech → spoken reply, all over the live
WebRTC call.

Requires `aiortc` (see [nixos-installation.md](nixos-installation.md) for the
NixOS setup). Incoming calls are auto-answered; hang up from your Delta Chat
client (or the bot can hang up via `dc_end_call`).

## Outgoing calls (the bot calls you)

> **Implementation notes (two fixes were needed to make outgoing connect):**
> 1. **Event-loop starvation (the main one).** aiortc drives ICE STUN
>    connectivity checks on the asyncio loop. `dc_start_call` used to return
>    right after the SDP exchange, the agent's turn resumed heavy AI/TTS work,
>    and the checks were starved — the offerer sat in `checking` forever. Fix:
>    `start_call` now *waits for the connection to establish before returning*,
>    keeping the agent parked so the loop is free for the handshake.
> 2. **Audio-only offer.** The `iceTrickling`/`mutedState` data channels' SCTP
>    transport wedges the offerer's ICE against a `max-bundle` answerer (the DC
>    mobile); outgoing offers are audio-only. Incoming keeps the data channels
>    (works as answerer). Tradeoff: outgoing can't receive trickled candidates,
>    but our offer carries our TURN relay so the peer can reach us.
>
> Both were pinned down with `DELTACHAT_CALL_ICE_DEBUG=true` (raises aioice/
> aiortc to DEBUG) and the in-process loopback harness
> (`tests/test_call_webrtc_loopback.py`, `pytest -m slow`).

The bot can proactively call a contact with the **`dc_start_call`** tool — ideal
from a scheduled/cron task: a reminder, an alert, a check-in. It takes the
recipient's `chat_token` (from one of their messages) and a required `opening`:

- `dc_start_call(chat_token=…, opening="Hi Simon, quick reminder to take your
  meds.")` — the `opening` is the exact words to say. It's synthesized **while
  the phone is still ringing** and played the instant they pick up, so there's no
  startup delay and no rate-limit exposure on the first line. Write it as natural
  speech, not a topic label.

`opening` is required because the agent placing the call already knows what it
wants to say — pre-rendering it is what makes the call speak instantly on pickup
(a post-pickup AI greeting would add a multi-second silent gap).

How the `opening` stays coherent: nothing is written to the call's conversation
history until the call connects, so an unanswered/declined call leaves no trace.
When the user replies, the AI is told what it opened with via a context note on
that first turn, so the conversation continues naturally.

It rings up to ~40s; if unanswered (or declined) the tool returns an error. Once
connected the call behaves exactly like an incoming one (same STT/AI/TTS, barge-in,
sentence streaming, and `dc_end_call` to hang up). Outgoing and incoming calls
share the same WebRTC/audio setup, so they can't drift apart.

## How it works

```
DC mobile  ──WebRTC audio──▶  aiortc  ──▶  silence detection  ──▶  STT
                                                                     │
   DC mobile  ◀──WebRTC audio──  aiortc  ◀──  TTS  ◀──  Hermes AI  ◀──┘
```

- Incoming audio is buffered per utterance; a ~1s pause marks the end of a turn.
- The transcript is injected into the normal Hermes session pipeline, so the
  agent has full context, tools, and memory — same as a text chat.
- The AI's reply is intercepted before it would be sent as a chat message and
  is instead spoken into the call via TTS.

## Barge-in

You can interrupt the bot mid-reply: as soon as you start speaking, the bot
stops talking and listens. To avoid a click or background noise cutting the bot
off, an interrupt is only triggered after ~0.25s of sustained voiced audio
(RMS-gated). On the next turn the model is told what you did vs didn't hear
(estimated from how much of the reply had played), so it won't assume you heard
the part it was cut off on.

## Configuration (environment variables)

All optional. Set in `~/.hermes/.env`.

### Speech-to-text

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DELTACHAT_CALL_STT_VOXTRAL` | off | When `true`, route call audio to **Mistral Voxtral** cloud STT (~1-2s, accurate). Requires `MISTRAL_API_KEY`. **Strongly recommended** — local Whisper `medium` on CPU is ~15-30x slower than realtime (≈30s for a 2s clip), unusable for live calls. When off, the locally configured STT provider is used. |

```bash
DELTACHAT_CALL_STT_VOXTRAL=true
```

> Note: enabling this sends call audio to Mistral's API. Leave it off if you
> require fully local speech processing (and expect high latency).

### Spoken-reply style

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DELTACHAT_CALL_PROMPT` | (built-in) | Ephemeral per-call system prompt that keeps replies short and TTS-friendly. Applied only during calls, never persisted to chat history. Override to change the calling persona/brevity. |

The built-in prompt instructs the agent to reply in 1-2 short spoken sentences
with no markdown/lists/emojis/URLs (cuts both AI and TTS latency, which scale
with response length), and to **delegate complex/long-running work to a subagent**
(which runs on the more capable default model) rather than doing heavy work
inline — especially important when `DELTACHAT_CALL_MODEL` points calls at a
smaller, faster model.

### Session isolation

A Delta Chat call happens inside the contact's chat, so by default it would
share the **same Hermes session/history as your text DM** with the bot. To keep
spoken turns (and their rough transcripts) out of the text conversation, calls
run in a **separate session** by default (a distinct `thread_id`).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DELTACHAT_CALL_SHARED_HISTORY` | off | When `true`, calls share one session with the text DM — the bot remembers across call↔text, at the cost of mixing spoken transcripts into the text history. When off (default), calls are isolated. |

Note: the `channel_prompt` itself is **never** persisted to history in either
mode — only the transcript and the AI's spoken reply are stored (in whichever
session applies).

### Per-call LLM model override (opt-in)

By default a call uses the same model as the chat. You can override the model
**only for calls** (e.g. a faster model for snappier turn-taking) without
affecting text chats. The override is installed on the call's session when the
call starts and removed automatically on hangup.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DELTACHAT_CALL_MODEL` | unset | Model name to use during calls (e.g. `mistral-small-latest`). Unset = no override. |
| `DELTACHAT_CALL_MODEL_PROVIDER` | unset | Optional provider for the override model. |
| `DELTACHAT_CALL_MODEL_API_KEY` | unset | Optional API key. If omitted, the gateway resolves the key from env/config as usual and applies the model/provider on top. |
| `DELTACHAT_CALL_MODEL_BASE_URL` | unset | Optional base URL. |

```bash
# Example: use a faster model for calls only
DELTACHAT_CALL_MODEL=mistral-small-latest
```

> This feature is implemented and tested but **not enabled by default** — leave
> `DELTACHAT_CALL_MODEL` unset to use your normal model for calls.

## Performance

Typical per-turn latency once warmed up (with Voxtral STT enabled):

| Stage | Time |
|---|---|
| turn-end silence detection | ~1.0s (fixed) |
| STT (Voxtral) | ~0.7-1.5s |
| AI (LLM) | ~3-12s, scales with response length & model |
| TTS | ~1.5-6s, scales with response length |

**Sentence-streaming TTS:** the reply is synthesized sentence-by-sentence and
the first chunk starts playing while the rest are still being synthesized. For
long replies this drops *time-to-first-audio* from the whole-response TTS time
(e.g. ~7s for 500 chars) to just the first sentence (~1.5s). The `perf` log line
reports `first_audio=` for this. Short replies are a single chunk (no change).

The concise-reply prompt is the main lever for total AI+TTS time. For lower AI
latency, consider the per-call model override above.

> Note: LLM-token streaming (overlapping AI generation itself with TTS) was
> evaluated and deferred — see `docs/plans/streaming-tts.md`. Sentence-streaming
> above gives most of the perceived-latency benefit without that complexity.

## Limitations

- Audio only; incoming video tracks are ignored.
- Whisper on AMD GPU (ROCm) is not yet supported — `ctranslate2` (faster-whisper's
  backend) is built for CUDA. Use Voxtral cloud STT instead.
